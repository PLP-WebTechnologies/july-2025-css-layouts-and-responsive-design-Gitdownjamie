        <h2>Assignment Summary</h2>
        <p>
            This webpage demonstrates my use of CSS Grid and Flexbox to build a responsive layout.
            Grid is used for the main page structure (sidebar + content), while Flexbox handles
            navigation and the cards inside the content. Media queries make sure the design adapts
            smoothly for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

    <!-- ================= HEADER ================= -->
    <!-- The header has a title and a navigation bar -->
    <header>
        <h1>My Responsive Website</h1>
        <nav class="navbar">
            <ul>
                <!-- Navigation links styled with Flexbox -->
                <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

    <!-- ================= MAIN LAYOUT ================= -->
    <!-- Using Grid for the overall page structure -->
    <main class="grid-layout">
        <!-- Sidebar area -->
        <aside class="sidebar">
            <h2>Sidebar</h2>
            <p>This section can hold quick links, categories, or ads.</p>
        </aside>

        <section class="content">
            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Resize the screen to see how the layout changes across devices.</p>

            <!-- Flexbox example: card layout -->
            <div class="card-container">
                <div class="card">Card 1</div>
                <div class="card">Card 2</div>
                <div class="card">Card 3</div>

                <h2>Assignment Write-Up</h2>
                <p>
                    I started by setting up the structure in HTML with a header, navigation, sidebar,
                    content, and footer. This gave me a clear skeleton to work with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the navigation bar, I used Flexbox because it makes it easy to align links
                    in one row. On smaller screens, I used media queries to stack the links vertically
                    so they remain readable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the main layout, I chose CSS Grid. On desktop, the grid has two columns (sidebar
                    and content). On tablets and mobile, the layout changes to one column so everything
                    stacks nicely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inside the content area, I styled the cards with Flexbox. On desktop, they display
                    in a row, and on mobile, they stack into a column.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used media queries at 768px (tablet) and 480px (mobile) to adjust fonts, spacing,
                    and layouts. This ensures the design looks good on all devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, I combined Grid for the big picture layout and Flexbox for smaller parts
                    like navigation and cards, making the whole site flexible and responsive.
